<h1>2.Level Wise Interactions</h1>
Let us consider a problem K-bonacci series where you are given an integer k and you are asked to find K-bonacci(n)

where f(n) is the nth K-bonacci and

<h3>"nth K-bonacci is the sum of its previous k terms in the K-bonacci series"</h3>

<h2>
Mathematical Induction(Simple and Strong form)
</h2>
<p>
According to mathematical induction we assume that while calulating the result for k-th level the result for (k-1)-th level is valid and exisiting

According to strong form of induction we assume that while caluclating the result for k-th level the result for (k-i)th level is valid and existing

-----------------
<h2>Thinking level wise to derive recurrence relations</h2>
<p> 
Let us say you are asked to compute K-Bonacci(5) and k = 3
 
And to solve these kind of problems we need to think level-wise.

Let 5 be the current level you are standing on since you are asked to calculate f(5)

As the statement says nth fibonacci f(n) is the sum of its previous k elements

Therefore, let us assume that previous levels are computed correctly(strong form of induction)

and f(n) is the sum of its previous levels

Therefore,the recurrence relation we obtain is given below,

``` python
    f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-3) +....+f(n-k)
```

</p>

```c++
int f(int level,int k){
    if(n<0)return -1;
    if(n<k)return n;
}
```
Well I know this didnot require that heavy math and stuff
because it was an easy problem let us understand it further with a slightly more comprehensive problem
