<h1>3.Choice Exploration</h1>
We already know the concept of level from the previous topic 

The statement of choice exploration is simple

Recursion is used to explore choices at every level 

<h3>Example</h3>
Let us  consider a problem which is similar to the previous problem 

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>

You are standing at a stair 0 and your goal is to reach the stair n and you are a tall guy who can take 1,2, or 3 steps at any stair give the total number of ways of reaching the nth stair

<h3>Solution</h4>

Let us consider the current level as the current stair we are standing on i.e 0 and let us assume we are given n=5 as argument

<h4>Choice Exploration:</h4>
We have three choice from current stair they are 

level + 1 

level + 2

level + 3
<h4>Pruning a choice:</h4>
lets say taking any one of these choices you reached a stair greater than n that means that particular choice must be pruned as it is not expected to take place

<h4>Choice takes to goal</h4>
let us say by taking any one of these choice you reached the nth stair that means that choice gives you "one" way to reach the goal

<h4>Deriving Recurrence Relations from Choices</h4>
In this problem the choices are 

level + 1

level + 2

level + 3

And on adding the choices we get the number of ways because if a choice takes you to goal that particular choice returns +1 way

Sample Recursion tree:

```cpp
                              |----1----|----1----|----1----|----1----5
                              |         |         |----2----5
                              |         |         |----3  (x)
                              |         |
                              |         |----2----|----1----5
                              |         |         |----2  (x)
                              |         |         |----3  (x)
                              |         |
                              |         |----3----5
                              |
                              |----2----|----1----|----1----5
                              |         |         |----2----5
                              |         |         |----3  (x)
                              |         |
                              |         |----2----5
                              |         |
                              |         |----3  (x)
                              |
                |----1--------|
                |             |
                |             |----3----|----1----5
                |             |         |----2  (x)
                |             |         |----3  (x)
                |             |
                |             |----2----5
                |             |
                |             |----3  (x)
                |
0-------------->|
                |
                |
                |             |----1----|----1----|----1----5
                |             |         |         |----2----5
                |             |         |         |----3  (x)
                |             |         |
                |             |         |----2----5
                |             |         |
                |             |         |----3  (x)
                |             |
                |----2--------|----2----|----1----5
                |             |         |----2  (x)
                |             |         |----3  (x)
                |             |
                |             |----3----5
                |
                |----3--------|----1----|----1----5
                              |         |----2  (x)
                              |         |----3  (x)
                              |
                              |----2----5
                              |
                              |----3  (x)

```
and therefore we can write

```cpp
int f(int level){
    if(level>n)return 0;//pruning
    if(level==n)return 1;//1 way
    return f(level+1) + f(level+2) +f(level+3); 
}
